# JournalStream Module - Documentation #

The JournalStream module is a group of modules that creates a moderated workflow for curating collections of content. It is part of the soon to be released Science Collaboration Framework. The primary useage scenario is within the academic and medical research context but can be applied to any use case needing a publishing/moderation workflow. The module has a few contrib dependencies but can run as-is out of the box.
